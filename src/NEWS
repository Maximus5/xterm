                            Patch #329 - 2017/06/12

     * add  control  sequences  for  reading  the Sixel and ReGIS graphics
       sizes (suggested by Ben Wong).
     * add  a  workaround  for  wcwidth  returning -1 for characters which
       should have been printable (FreeBSD #219800).
     * fix a bug in font initialization from patch #328 (FreeBSD #219800).
     * fix  a special case in HideCursor which assigned a bold font to the
       slot  used  for  normal  font  in changes for italics in patch #307
       (Debian #858304).
     * updates for ReGIS (Ross Combs):
          + Strings  specified  with  no  command  are used as "comments".
            Print these in the log when tracing.
          + Catch  attempts  to use "alternate display" mode (AKA "blink")
            from the GIGI, but do not implement it.
          + The  T(M)  command  should only multiply the height by 10, not
            20.
          + Make  the  S(E)  command reset more state than just the screen
            contents.
          + Remove two rotation variables which were only being printed.
          + Numerous minor fixes and comment updates in the R command.
          + Unknown R command option names trigger an empty response.
          + Fix  the  output  position after printing rotated text (it was
            missing the the sign before).
          + Fix  the  position  change  with pixelvectors and rotated text
            (the rotation transform was not being applied).
          + Update  the TODO list and remove a verification FIXME (slanted
            text positioning is correct as is).
          + Emulate  the  approximately  1.4x  enlargement  for text which
            isn't rotated at right angles.
          + Only  update the color planes specified in the plane mask (the
            W command's F option).
     * fix  a  bug  introduced by the changes to font information in patch
       #328.   When  processing  the  "checkfont"  option  of  the  locale
       resource,  the  program  referred  to the request data, to an array
       which  was  only  allocated  in  the new/result widget (report by H
       Merijn Brand).
     * fix  a  missing assignment initialization to make the utf8 resource
       control  whether  escape sequences to enable/disable UTF-8 mode are
       allowed.
