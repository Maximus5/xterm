                            Patch #327 - 2016/10/07

     * add  a  check in the function which handles end-of-line wrapping to
       ensure   that   C1   controls   are   allocated   one  column  when
       allowC1Printable is set (Debian #738794).
     * use  consistent  error-checking  after  strtol  calls, fixes a case
       where  a  query  with  OSC 6 did not ensure there was a valid color
       number (report by Alex Smith).
     * add -baudrate option, for testing ncurses.
     * always  generate  the CASE_xxx symbols in VTparse.h and Tekparse.h,
       as  part of a change to improve debug-logging. This makes the build
       always depend upon awk.
     * modify   allowC1Printable   to  disallow  codes  160-254  as  being
       equivalent  to  codes  32-126 when parsing escape sequences (Debian
       #839220).
     * amend  fix from patch #326 for TrueType fonts to exclude the hidden
       character used for double-width cells (report by Grady Martin).
     * fix a typo in ctlseqs.ms
